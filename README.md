# amr_trajectory
This project focuses on Trajectory Visualization and Storage for AMR Navigation using ROS 2. It automates trajectory tracking in RViz and enables saving trajectory data in CSV formats. The system includes two C++ ROS nodes: one for publishing and saving trajectory data and another for reading and visualizing it. Ideal for AMRs in manufacturing.
